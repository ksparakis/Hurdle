======

Dynamic Form Submitter , for testing php server code without having to create the front end.

#How To Use
------------

* First off you must have a local webserver running, I recommend Xampp for those who don't know anything about local webservers.
* Download the Hurdle folder and save it to your htdocs(This is for xampp users) or where ever your webserver is set.
* Open a web browser and go to "localhost/hurdel" or whatever url you have set the file in and enjoy.

##Warnings
- Opening the file directly from the folder will not work, this is because your browser disallows any code opened from a file to submit a form.
